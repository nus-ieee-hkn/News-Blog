On the 11th November 2015, The IEEE- Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) Lambda Omega Chapter of NUS Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE) Department inducted over 20 new members to the society. A special thing this year was that not only students are
inducted but also Professor Low Teck Seng, CEO of National Research Foundation (NRF) and a Faculty Member at the ECE
Department.
