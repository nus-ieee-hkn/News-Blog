Are you passionate about helping others? Are you eager to share your knowledge with other people? If so, we **strongly**
encourage you to join our Peer Tutoring Scheme as a peer-tutor this coming semester.
 
The Peer Tutoring Scheme is a joint initiative by the IEEE-HKN NUS Chapter and ECE Department to provide students in
dire academic states with help. Under this initiative, we wish to engage senior ECE students as Peer-Tutors to
<span style="color:blue">volunteer</span> their time in tutoring/mentoring these students in year 1 & 2 core modules.
Previous batches of students and peer-tutors have seen fruitful results through this meaningful scheme.
 
If you are keen on becoming a peer-tutor, do note the following details before completing the application form located
at the end of this email.

* To be clear, you will not be replacing any lecturers, TAs or GAs. Instead you will help to clarify any doubts that
  your juniors may have. The Department will ensure that you have relevant materials and aid from the respective module
  lecturers.
* Experience in teaching is preferable but not compulsory. We will provide guidance to all peer-tutors.
* You may rank the module(s) you are interested to peer-tutor (min. B and above) and you will be paired with a small
  group of juniors per module.
* Commitment is one semester; please ensure that you have sufficient time for your own studies as well.
* You will be notified for an interview once we have processed your application
